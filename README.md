### 🚀 About Me

Hey there, I’m Sibasis — a backend-focused developer who enjoys building systems that *work*, scale, and don’t fall apart under pressure. I’m passionate about automation, clean APIs, and solving real-world problems through code.

Currently diving deep into:

* 🧠 Java + Spring Boot (my bread and butter)
* 🛢️SQL (because good data needs a solid home)
* ⚙️ REST API design and clean architecture principles
* 📈 Real-world backend workflows like payments, auth, and service integrations

I like systems that *just work*. Frontend is someone else’s party — I build the engine under the hood.
